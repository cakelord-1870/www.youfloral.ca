<p>Wondering what to do now that you&#8217;ve assembled your works of art? Obviously step one is to congratulate yourself, then step two is to post on insta (tag us @_youfloral)&#8230;. and now its time to think about where to put them until your big day! Depending on what you&#8217;ve made, you after-care instructions will differ a bit, keep reading to learn what to do!</p>
<h2><strong> Boutonnieres, corsages, flower crowns</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Find a tupperware container, line it with damp paper towel, put your items inside, and close the lids. Place everything in your fridge, at the warmest setting. If you keep fruits/veggies in the fridge, put them in sealed plastic bags – they emit gases that’ll make your flowers prematurely die!</li>
<li>Given that these items won’t have hydration, we suggest making them as close to your event as possible, the night before is ideal!</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Vase arrangements</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>These are fantastic because they obviously have water with them. Make sure there is lots of water in the vase, no leaves underwater, and just keep these in a cool dry place – don’t refrigerate! You can make these two days before the event no problem.</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Greenery on a table</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>If you’re loose laying greenery on the table, you can pre-cut the pieces in advance, just keep them in vases/buckets of water until you’re ready to use them. You can lay out the greenery the morning of your event, or even the night before – eucalyptus and ruscus are quite hardy, so they’ll be fine out of water. If its really hot out, the greenery will begin to dry out, if that’s not your vibe, then minimize the amount of time that the greenery is resting on the tables.</li>
<li>If you’re wiring the greenery into garlands, you can put the garlands into misted plastic bags (garbage bags are great), and then tie up the bag to keep everything damp. Keep the bag in a cool room, or put it in the refrigerator.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Wet foam (i.e. arch arrangements)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Keep an eye on the foam to make sure it stays damp; you can use your kitchen sink sprayer or garden hose to refresh the foam. Flowers don’t love being in foam, so try to minimize the time it’ll be chilling in it.</li>
</ul>

<p>Eucalyptus is amazing for all many reasons, including  it’s beautiful aroma, color, appearance, and versatility. It can be used for its aesthetic appearance to decorate your home and the beautiful fragrance will keep your rooms smelling fresh. The great thing about eucalyptus is it’s versatility, whether fresh or dried, you’ll have many moments of enjoyment.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youfloral.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Eucalyptus_101_3.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4604" src="https://www.youfloral.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Eucalyptus_101_3.jpg" alt="Eucalyptus 101" width="650" height="650" srcset="https://www.youfloral.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Eucalyptus_101_3.jpg 650w, https://www.youfloral.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Eucalyptus_101_3-480x480.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 650px, 100vw" /></a></p>
<p>The wonderful about eucalyptus compared to flowers is its resilience. Long after a bouquet has to be sent to the compost pile, a bunch of eucalyptus can still be used as decoration or turned into anything from a wreath, to a wall hanging, or a natural dye.</p>
<p>I’m going to attempt to answer all your ‘burning’ eucalyptus questions, if you have more &#8211; leave in comments!</p>
<h2><strong>How long does it last out of water?</strong></h2>
<p>The average lifespan of a eucalyptus stem out of water is about 1-2 days, this makes it a fantastic choice for weddings &#8211; no worries about making a garland and leaving it!</p>
<h3><strong>How long does eucalyptus last?</strong></h3>
<p>It will stay fresh for about 3 weeks, depending on things like heat (it doesn’t like being in hot rooms), how often you change the water, and how often you cut the stems. To prolong its life you should change the water regularly, and cut the ends using pruning shears about once every 3-5 days. Dried eucalyptus will last forever!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youfloral.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Eucalyptus_101.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4602" src="https://www.youfloral.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Eucalyptus_101.jpg" alt="Eucalyptus 101" width="650" height="650" srcset="https://www.youfloral.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Eucalyptus_101.jpg 650w, https://www.youfloral.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Eucalyptus_101-480x480.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 650px, 100vw" /></a></p>
<h3><strong>Scent:</strong></h3>
<p>Fresh eucalyptus has a vivid and vibrant scent (some varieties smell more than others &#8211; baby blue eucalyptus is the most fragrant) once it dries, it’ll lose the scent.</p>
<h3><strong>Color:</strong></h3>
<p>The natural fresh color is a muted sage green, and as it dries, the color fades to a deeper hue and takes on more of a ‘silver tone’. As time goes on, the coloration will continue to deepen.</p>
<h3><strong>Use in bouquets:</strong></h3>
<p>You can use both fresh and dried eucalyptus in bouquets, the fresh is easier to work with, given the flexibility of the stems. Once the eucalyptus is dried, the leaves and stems are more rigid, requiring a bit more finesse and care to avoid causing the leaves to break.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youfloral.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Eucalyptus_101_5.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4606" src="https://www.youfloral.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Eucalyptus_101_5.jpg" alt="Eucalyptus 101" width="650" height="650" srcset="https://www.youfloral.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Eucalyptus_101_5.jpg 650w, https://www.youfloral.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Eucalyptus_101_5-480x480.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 650px, 100vw" /></a></p>
<h3><strong>Use in showers:</strong></h3>
<p>Fresh eucalyptus is ideal for hanging inside your shower, the steam will release the essential oils, giving you a spa like experience! The best type to use is baby blue, as it has the most scent. Once you notice the scent dissipating and the leaves becoming rigid, remove them from your shower and compost &#8211; or put them in a vase for an everlasting bouquet.</p>
<h3><strong>Which ones smells the most?</strong></h3>
<p>The baby blue eucalyptus has the strongest scent, the others definently have a scent, but it is more subtle than the baby blue. You’ll notice that the scent is so pronounced with the baby blue, it’ll be on your hands just from handling it!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youfloral.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Eucalyptus_101_4.jpeg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4605" src="https://www.youfloral.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Eucalyptus_101_4.jpeg" alt="Eucalyptus 101" width="650" height="650" srcset="https://www.youfloral.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Eucalyptus_101_4.jpeg 650w, https://www.youfloral.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Eucalyptus_101_4-480x480.jpeg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 650px, 100vw" /></a></p>
<h3><strong>Types of Eucalyptus </strong></h3>
<p>There are more than 700 species of eucalyptus!!! We carry silver dollar, baby blue, seeded, parvifolia, and willow.</p>
<h3><strong>Where does eucalyptus come from?</strong></h3>
<p>It is native to Australia, which is obviously very far away from us! Ours comes from California, and a fresh batches comes each week.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youfloral.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Eucalyptus_101_2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4603" src="https://www.youfloral.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Eucalyptus_101_2.jpg" alt="Eucalyptus 101" width="650" height="650" srcset="https://www.youfloral.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Eucalyptus_101_2.jpg 650w, https://www.youfloral.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Eucalyptus_101_2-480x480.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 650px, 100vw" /></a></p>
<h3><b>Whats the difference between the types?</b></h3>
<ul>
<li>Baby blue is the classic eucalyptus. It’s a tall single stem with outward branching stems up the whole stem. The fragrance is amazing and it dries really nicely.</li>
<li>Silver Dollar Eucalyptus is the classic wedding garland and bouquet choice. This one has those large, more round leaves that kind of bounce. You’ve probably seen large bouquets of this one for weddings (all over Pinterest!) and smaller stems in vases for home decor. I love to break up a large stem of silver dollar eucalyptus into smaller vases for different vignettes around the house and decor on open shelving.</li>
<li>Seeded Eucalyptus has larger stems (compared to the silver dollar eucalyptus) and can be broken down into smaller stems for little vases. It’s called seeded eucalyptus because of the seed pods. One thing I will note about this one is that the seeds are heavy, they have a tendency to “droop”, so you’ll need to cut them into smaller pieces or find flowers/other greenery to support them.</li>
<li>Willow eucalyptus had a delicate appearance with small long leaves. I really love the shape of this one! It has a “drooping” appearance, and it’s perfect as a space filler.</li>
<li>Parvifolia eucalyptus &#8211; Like all eucalyptuses, it&#8217;s extremely hardy and lasts a long time. The lightness of these leaves adds a unique feeling of up-lift to any floral arrangement you add them to. The great thing about this eucalyptus is how upright the stems are, no droop here! The semi-negative thing, the end levels can get a bit stanky, but just pick them off and boom- problem solved.</li>
</ul>
<p>I hope you guys enjoyed learned about eucalyptus! Follow me on social media @_youfloral &#8211; I love connecting with you!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dreaming of gorgeous blooms for your wedding day but working within a budget? We&#8217;ve come up with 11 tips to make your floral vision a reality without breaking the bank.</p>
<h3>1. Re-purpose and Re-use</h3>
<p>There are so many ways to re-purpose your florals.</p>
<ul>
<li>Use the florals from the ceremony to do double duty on the escort-card table or the bar.</li>
<li>Bridesmaid bouquets work great for reception tables.</li>
<li>Create bouquets in mason jars and place on shepherds hooks as aisle markers, and then move inside as table centerpieces</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.youfloral.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/mason-jar-bouquet.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2879" src="https://www.youfloral.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/mason-jar-bouquet.jpg" alt="mason jar bouquet" width="650" height="650" srcset="https://www.youfloral.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/mason-jar-bouquet.jpg 650w, https://www.youfloral.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/mason-jar-bouquet-480x480.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 650px, 100vw" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Photo via mikoweddings.com</em></p>
<h3>2. Go Minimalist</h3>
<p>Place single-stem flowers, like roses, babies&#8217; breath, or carnations, in slim bud holders. Arrange groups of vases at varying heights for a stylish effect</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youfloral.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Babies_breath_vase.jpeg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2871" src="https://www.youfloral.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Babies_breath_vase.jpeg" alt="Babies breath vase" width="650" height="650" srcset="https://www.youfloral.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Babies_breath_vase.jpeg 650w, https://www.youfloral.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Babies_breath_vase-480x480.jpeg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 650px, 100vw" /></a></p>
<h3>3. Incorporate Dried Florals</h3>
<p>Dried florals can be expensive, there is a lot of labor involved with drying, but the awesome thing about them is they last forever! You can easily re-sell them, no worries about wilting.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youfloral.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/dried_florals.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2874" src="https://www.youfloral.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/dried_florals.jpg" alt="dried florals" width="650" height="650" srcset="https://www.youfloral.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/dried_florals.jpg 650w, https://www.youfloral.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/dried_florals-480x480.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 650px, 100vw" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Photo via <a class="linkModuleActionButton" href="http://www.mylittlefabric.com/en/table-de-noel-la-foret-de-fleurs-sechees/?utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=pinterest&amp;utm_campaign=tailwind_tribes&amp;utm_content=tribes&amp;utm_term=659818162_24471286_639876" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">mylittlefabric.com</a></em></p>
<h3>4. Swap Smartly</h3>
<p>Certain flowers are more expensive than others (think carnations vs roses). Use the pricier blooms sparingly &#8211; your bridal bouquet is a good place to splurge, and use the less expensive florals in your bridesmaid bouquets. If you’re making an arch, this is a good spot to use budget blooms &#8211; from afar people won’t even be able to tell (plus, carnations truly are beautiful).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youfloral.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/carnations.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2872" src="https://www.youfloral.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/carnations.jpg" alt="carnations" width="650" height="650" srcset="https://www.youfloral.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/carnations.jpg 650w, https://www.youfloral.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/carnations-480x480.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 650px, 100vw" /></a></p>
<h3>5. Go Thrifting</h3>
<p>Vases can be expensive &#8211; check out thrift stores, miss-matching adds a sense of whimsy, plus it’s fun to hunt for treasure! Raiding grandmas cabinets for teapots or mason jars is another source for vases that don’t cost anything!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youfloral.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/flowers_in_teapot.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2877" src="https://www.youfloral.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/flowers_in_teapot.jpg" alt="flowers in teapot" width="650" height="650" srcset="https://www.youfloral.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/flowers_in_teapot.jpg 650w, https://www.youfloral.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/flowers_in_teapot-480x480.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 650px, 100vw" /></a></p>
<h3>6. Take a Walk in the Woods</h3>
<p>If you have a friend or family member that has property, take a wander through the woods; salal and ferns grow plentifully and are perfect to add into arrangements</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youfloral.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/foraging_flowers.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2878" src="https://www.youfloral.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/foraging_flowers.jpg" alt="foraging flowers" width="650" height="650" srcset="https://www.youfloral.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/foraging_flowers.jpg 650w, https://www.youfloral.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/foraging_flowers-480x480.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 650px, 100vw" /></a></p>
<h3>7. Down-scale</h3>
<p>It goes without saying that the larger the arrangement, the more flowers it needs, therefore the higher cost. Think about buying smaller vases, or making your arrangements more compact, you can still get a similar vibe but spend less.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youfloral.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/wedding_centerpiece.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2880" src="https://www.youfloral.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/wedding_centerpiece.jpg" alt="wedding centerpiece" width="650" height="650" srcset="https://www.youfloral.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/wedding_centerpiece.jpg 650w, https://www.youfloral.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/wedding_centerpiece-480x480.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 650px, 100vw" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Photo via <a class="linkModuleActionButton" href="https://theweddingshoppe.net/simple-wedding-flowers-and-arrangements/?utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=pinterest&amp;utm_campaign=tailwind_smartloop&amp;utm_content=smartloop&amp;utm_term=22412590?utm_term=wedding%20centerpieces&amp;utm_campaign=2860665825" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">theweddingshoppe.net</a></em></p>
<h3>8. Go Green(ery)</h3>
<p>Don&#8217;t underestimate the beauty of greenery in your bouquets. It’s cost-effective, takes up space,  and adds a lot of size and texture to arrangements</p>

<h3>9. For-go Flowers on Tables</h3>
<p>Greenery is gorgeous, long-lasting, and easy peasy &#8211; no worrying about wilting or designing. Using greenery on tables is elegant, beautiful, and affordable.</p>

<h3>10. Share The Love</h3>
<p>Flowers have a pretty decent lifespan (as long as they are kept in water). Try finding another couple with a wedding close to yours and share your florals. This especially works well if you have a eucalyptus-focused wedding &#8211; that stuff lasts forever! A tip here, organize these months in advance, it’s harder to find someone last minute to join in with you! I wouldn’t recommend sharing wedding party bouquets, since they’ll be out of water for quite a while when you’re photographing.</p>

<h3>11. DIY!</h3>
<p>Making your own bouquets and arrangements will save you a ton of moolah. Grab a few friends, a glass or two of wine, and have fun! If arranging bouquets feels a bit daunting, you can always opt to get a florist to make those, and just stick to making the centerpieces.</p>
<p>We typically recommend getting your flowers 3 days before and then arranging your flowers the day or two before the event.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m so excited to have partnered with Erin from Bowie Mae (<a href="https://www.bowiemae.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.bowiemae.ca/</a>) to create this mini-tutorial. Erin is a dried floral expert &#8211; I so appreciate her joining up with me to teach you how to press your own flowers/greenery with some items in your home!</p>
<p><strong>What you need:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Flowers &#8211; could be from your garden, local florist, or foraged treasures from a hike</li>
<li>Book &#8211; ideally something big and heavy</li>
<li>Parchment paper</li>
<li>Scissors</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Steps:</strong></h3>
<h4>Step 1:</h4>
<p>Gather small flowers, greenery, and/or petals. It’s best to forage on a dry, sunny day, to avoid any moisture or dew. If wet flowers are pressed, it’ll invite mold. The best time for pressing is when flowers are dry, freshly harvested, and fully bloomed.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youfloral.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/ranunculus_and_roses.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2864" src="https://www.youfloral.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/ranunculus_and_roses.jpg" alt="ranunculus and roses" width="650" height="650" srcset="https://www.youfloral.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/ranunculus_and_roses.jpg 650w, https://www.youfloral.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/ranunculus_and_roses-480x480.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 650px, 100vw" /></a></p>
<h4>Step 2:</h4>
<p>Line your book with a folded piece of parchment paper. Find a page near the back of the book, to add more weight to the flowers. Deconstruct the flowers or greenery, if needed. Smaller, more delicate blooms have a better chance of successfully pressing.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youfloral.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/pressed_florals.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2867" src="https://www.youfloral.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/pressed_florals.jpg" alt="pressed florals" width="650" height="650" srcset="https://www.youfloral.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/pressed_florals.jpg 650w, https://www.youfloral.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/pressed_florals-480x480.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 650px, 100vw" /></a></p>
<h4>Step 3:</h4>
<p>Remove any unwanted leaves or brown spots from the flower. Place each one face down on your paper, checking for any folds on the petals.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youfloral.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/pressed_roses.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2863" src="https://www.youfloral.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/pressed_roses.jpg" alt="pressed roses" width="650" height="650" srcset="https://www.youfloral.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/pressed_roses.jpg 650w, https://www.youfloral.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/pressed_roses-480x480.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 650px, 100vw" /></a></p>
<h4>Step 4:</h4>
<p>Carefully close the book and add more weight by stacking any kind of books you have around your home.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youfloral.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/stack_of_flower_books.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2865" src="https://www.youfloral.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/stack_of_flower_books.jpg" alt="stack of flower books" width="650" height="650" srcset="https://www.youfloral.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/stack_of_flower_books.jpg 650w, https://www.youfloral.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/stack_of_flower_books-480x480.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 650px, 100vw" /></a></p>
<p>Viola! Now &#8211; you wait! In 2-3 weeks you’ll have dried, pressed florals memories that are preserved forever.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youfloral.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/book_with_pressed_flowers.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2866" src="https://www.youfloral.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/book_with_pressed_flowers.jpg" alt="book with pressed flowers" width="650" height="650" srcset="https://www.youfloral.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/book_with_pressed_flowers.jpg 650w, https://www.youfloral.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/book_with_pressed_flowers-480x480.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 650px, 100vw" /></a></p>

<p>Hydrangeas are so gorgeous and huge &#8211; but they wilt so easily! All is not lost though if your hydrangeas decide to kick the bucket &#8211; you can revive them with these tips!</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re like me &#8211; you want to know the nuts and bolts behind things&#8230;why o&#8217; why do these blooms do this! The answer lies in their stems. The woody stems have a sticky substance that clogs the stems, preventing water from reaching the blooms. As their name might hint at, hydrangeas need hydration!</p>
<p>To hopefully not get to the point of revival, follow these tips when you first get your hydrangeas.</p>
<ul>
<li>Never cut the ends of your hydrangeas with scissors (or any flower for that matter), scissors aren&#8217;t sharp enough; they pinch the stems, reducing water uptake.</li>
<li>Trim the stems at an angle, and add a small slit at the bottom to help them suck up more water.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you&#8217;ve done this and discover a bloom or two isn&#8217;t working with you&#8230; It&#8217;s time to revive!</p>
<h3>Materials You Will Need:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Wilted hydrangeas</li>
<li>Hot water (almost boiling)</li>
<li>2 vases/mason jars</li>
<li>Sharp knife/pruners</li>
</ul>
<h3>Directions:</h3>
<ol>
<li>Boil water, let it cool slightly, and then pour into a vase.</li>
<li>Using scissors or pruners, cut the ends of the hydrangeas at a 45-degree angle. Then cut a small slit vertically up the middle of the newly trimmed stem.</li>
<li>Place the hydrangea(s) in the vase filled with hot water for 30 seconds</li>
<li>Put the blooms into a vase filled with room temperature water.</li>
<li>If the blooms are not too old, within a couple of hours they will have completely revived. Occasionally, the revival process will take several hours.</li>
<li>If you&#8217;re tried this and its worked (or hasn&#8217;t) &#8211; drop me a note below and tell me how it went!</li>
</ol>
<p>xoxo<br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We&#8217;re planners and list makers &#8211; so we thought we&#8217;d make you guys a list of essential supplies to gather in advance of your florals arriving! Prepping in advance will make your life so much easier, no one likes making a mad dash last minute and discovering that every store in town is randomly sold out of buckets!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youfloral.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Tools_of_the_Trade_Essential_Checklist.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2853" src="https://www.youfloral.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Tools_of_the_Trade_Essential_Checklist.jpg" alt="Tools of the Trade - Essential Checklist" width="650" height="650" srcset="https://www.youfloral.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Tools_of_the_Trade_Essential_Checklist.jpg 650w, https://www.youfloral.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Tools_of_the_Trade_Essential_Checklist-480x480.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 650px, 100vw" /></a></p>
<p><strong>We&#8217;ve put on our thinking caps and come up with some items that will help make your DIY experience successful and fun, keep reading if you like lists!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Time</strong> – They don&#8217;t call it the gift of time for nothing! Set aside time to both prep, and arrange your flowers. Calling in your best bud or two is a super smart idea, it&#8217;ll be way more fun, and many hands make light work!</p>
<p><strong>Work space</strong> – You don&#8217;t need anywhere fancy, but having a folding table on hand is helpful so you can spread out and work if your kitchen table isn&#8217;t large enough for you and your buds.</p>
<p><strong>Fridge Space </strong>– Do not store your bouquets in the fridge!!! However, if you&#8217;re making boutineers, you can put them in the fridge overnight to keep them in peak condition.</p>
<p><strong>Vases/Mason Jars </strong>– After you make your arrangements, you&#8217;ll want to keep them in water until your day, so they&#8217;ll need a space to wait and hang out.<strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong>Buckets</strong> – Gather together some water holding receptables (tupperwear bins/buckets from hardware store/bathroom trash cans). You don&#8217;t want to crowd your flowers or they will bruise, so make sure you have enough (good rule of thumb is 2 bunches per trash can). Don&#8217;t combine flowers with short stems in the same buckets as your greenery, they will let lost/squished!</p>
<p><strong>Waste bins </strong>– You are going to have a lot of stems and leaves lying about, keeping your workspace tidy by putting waste into a bin will go a long way to keeping you organized and on track.</p>
<p><strong>Snippers</strong> – Kitchen scissors aren&#8217;t sharp enough, and your gardening shears are likely too bulky for most stems. Snippers are quite affordable, have a few pair on hand so that you don&#8217;t have to arm wrestle for snipper time.</p>
<p><strong>Floral tape</strong> – Floral tape is the key to bouquet and boutineer making, buy a roll or two.</p>
<p><strong>Boutstix </strong> – This is just a suggestion if you&#8217;re making boutineers, but these magnets make it so much easier to make boutineers &#8211; and they also don&#8217;t result in pin holes in the fancy suits!</p>
<p><strong>Ribbon</strong> – Ribbon is a fun addition to your bouquets, and a way to incorporate your color scheme.</p>
<p><strong>Hot glue</strong> – Having a hot glue gun on hand is helpful to secure ribbon, you could also use pins if you wanted. IMPORTANT: Do not use hot glue on flowers, buy floral glue if you plan on gluing blooms.</p>
<p><strong>Transport tubs and tissue paper</strong> – Having a plan is always a good idea, and strategizing how to transport your flowers shouldn&#8217;t be left out!  You can use cardboard boxes or plastic storage tubs, just be sure to have ample space; you don’t want your arrangements getting crushed. Crumpled newspaper or towels can help create space and secure them in place (no one wants arrangements falling all over the place as you careen down the highway).</p>
<p>There you have it, a list of must have things, and a couple tips and tricks as well! if you have any questions, feel free to drop us a line  anytime &#8211; contactyoufloral@gmail.com</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you&#8217;re as obsessed as us with the hit reality show &#8216;Love is Blind&#8217;, you&#8217;re not content to just watch the show, you have to find out every little detail and deeply contemplate the question&#8230;. Is love at first sight really real???</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll leave those great philosophical questions to you to solve&#8230; but we&#8217;re here to de-mystify the bouquets at the alter and share their recipes so you can recreate them!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youfloral.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Love_is_Blind_Bouquet_Inspo.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2849" src="https://www.youfloral.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Love_is_Blind_Bouquet_Inspo.png" alt="Love is Blind - Bouquet Inspo" width="650" height="650" srcset="https://www.youfloral.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Love_is_Blind_Bouquet_Inspo.png 650w, https://www.youfloral.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Love_is_Blind_Bouquet_Inspo-480x480.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 650px, 100vw" /></a></p>
<p>Let&#8217;s start with Lauren&#8217;s. This bouquet is gorgeous for so many reasons, the trailing, traipsing greenery punctuated by pops of colour really makes it eye-catching and unique. If you&#8217;re looking to recreate this bouquet, <strong>you&#8217;ll need:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Italian Ruscus</li>
<li>Plumosa Fern</li>
<li>Red Mini Carnations</li>
<li>Soft Pink Roses</li>
<li>Hot Pink Roses</li>
<li>Purple Waxflower</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.youfloral.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Love_is_Blind_Bouquet_Inspo2.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2848" src="https://www.youfloral.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Love_is_Blind_Bouquet_Inspo2.png" alt="Love is Blind - Bouquet Inspo" width="650" height="650" srcset="https://www.youfloral.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Love_is_Blind_Bouquet_Inspo2.png 650w, https://www.youfloral.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Love_is_Blind_Bouquet_Inspo2-480x480.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 650px, 100vw" /></a></p>
<p>Next up is Amber&#8217;s. This bouquet style is so popular now, it&#8217;s easy to see why it&#8217;s trending! Even though there is one colour palate, the soft variation really gives it a romantic feel, and roses are just so gorgeous.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re looking to create this for yourself, <strong>you&#8217;ll need:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Silver Dollar Eucalyptus</li>
<li>Olive Leaves</li>
<li>Baby Blue Eucalyptus</li>
<li>White Panda Anemone</li>
<li>Soft Pink Roses</li>
<li>White Roses</li>
<li>White Lisianthus</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks for coming along and indulging our love for anything gushy and romantic&#8230;we&#8217;d love to see 2020 weddings take some inspo from Love is Blind !</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So you&#8217;ve decided to DIY your wedding flowers (yay &#8211; you&#8217;re going to do great!). Your blooms need a bit of tender loving care once they arrive, follow these easy steps and you&#8217;ll be on your way!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youfloral.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Unpacking_Your_Flowers_Florist_Near_Me.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2842" src="https://www.youfloral.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Unpacking_Your_Flowers_Florist_Near_Me.jpg" alt="Unpacking Your Flowers Florist Near Me" width="650" height="650" srcset="https://www.youfloral.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Unpacking_Your_Flowers_Florist_Near_Me.jpg 650w, https://www.youfloral.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Unpacking_Your_Flowers_Florist_Near_Me-480x480.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 650px, 100vw" /></a></p>
<p>First off, it&#8217;s time for some expectation management &#8211; take a deep breath, don&#8217;t fret, and relax &#8211; you totally got this!!</p>
<ul>
<li>When your flowers arrive, they&#8217;ll look thirsty and tired &#8211; that&#8217;s totally normal &#8211; they&#8217;ve been on a journey, and just need some time to recuperate and they&#8217;ll be back in action!</li>
<li>Not every bud will be perfect. I follow the 5% rule, meaning that out of 100 stems, 5 stems may break while unpacking, look a little too mushed, etc. Don&#8217;t let this stress you out! It&#8217;s totally normal and to be expected when dealing with fresh/live products.</li>
<li>One more thing to note&#8230;your flowers are shipped super fresh, so fresh that they haven&#8217;t fully opened up &#8211; don&#8217;t fret&#8230;over the next few days they&#8217;ll open up to their full expression!</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.youfloral.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Unpacking_Your_Flowers.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2841" src="https://www.youfloral.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Unpacking_Your_Flowers.jpg" alt="Unpacking Your Flowers" width="650" height="650" srcset="https://www.youfloral.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Unpacking_Your_Flowers.jpg 650w, https://www.youfloral.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Unpacking_Your_Flowers-480x480.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 650px, 100vw" /></a></p>
<p>So now you&#8217;re ready&#8230;you&#8217;ve got some good tunes on, you&#8217;ve got your crew, and you&#8217;ve got snacks. It&#8217;s now time to get down to business.</p>
<h3><strong>Step 1: Count &amp; Confirm</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Count the bunches as you are pulling them out of the box. Get in contact with us right away if anything is awry.</li>
<li>If you ordered roses, note that they are packed in two layers to ensure protection during shipping. From the top angle, it will appear that you only have 12 rose stems in the bunch; however, below this layer, there is a second layer containing the remaining 13 roses (yes, we threw in a bonus one because we&#8217;re sweet like that)</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.youfloral.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Unpacking_Your_Flowers_Snip.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2840" src="https://www.youfloral.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Unpacking_Your_Flowers_Snip.jpg" alt="Unpacking Your Flowers Snip" width="650" height="650" srcset="https://www.youfloral.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Unpacking_Your_Flowers_Snip.jpg 650w, https://www.youfloral.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Unpacking_Your_Flowers_Snip-480x480.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 650px, 100vw" /></a></p>
<h3><strong>Step 2: Snip </strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Give everything a fresh cut (about 1 inch off), at an angle, with your snips (scissors don&#8217;t work well).</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.youfloral.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Unpacking_Your_Flowers_Remove_Foliage.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2844" src="https://www.youfloral.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Unpacking_Your_Flowers_Remove_Foliage.jpg" alt="Unpacking Your Flowers Remove Foliage" width="650" height="650" srcset="https://www.youfloral.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Unpacking_Your_Flowers_Remove_Foliage.jpg 650w, https://www.youfloral.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Unpacking_Your_Flowers_Remove_Foliage-480x480.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 650px, 100vw" /></a></p>
<h3><strong>Step 3: Remove Foliage</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Some flowers will have lots of foliage on the stem, remove any that falls below the waterline of your containers. When removing foliage, be very careful and gentle to not damage the stem.</li>
<li>Removing any foliage that falls below the waterline will help prevent the growth of mold or bacteria which could cause premature wilting.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.youfloral.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Unpacking_Your_Flowers_Hydrate.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2843" src="https://www.youfloral.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Unpacking_Your_Flowers_Hydrate.jpg" alt="Unpacking Your Flowers Hydrate" width="650" height="650" srcset="https://www.youfloral.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Unpacking_Your_Flowers_Hydrate.jpg 650w, https://www.youfloral.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Unpacking_Your_Flowers_Hydrate-480x480.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 650px, 100vw" /></a></p>
<h3><strong>Step 4: Hydrate</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Hydrating your flowers is the most important, super key, integral, non-negotiated step (am I articulating the importance well enough?). If you don&#8217;t have time to do steps 2 and 3, jump right to step 4 and then re-convene later to do the earlier steps. Trust me, your flowers will thank you.</li>
<li>Allow flowers at least 4 hours to hydrate before you start arranging. Make sure everything has elbow room &#8211; no crowding. Periodically check the water levels, flowers drink a lot of water when they first arrive and the water may need to be refilled</li>
<li>If you ordered roses, leave them in their cardboard packaging while they hydrate.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.youfloral.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Unpacking_Your_Flowers_Remove_the_guard_petals.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2839" src="https://www.youfloral.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Unpacking_Your_Flowers_Remove_the_guard_petals.jpg" alt="Unpacking Your Flowers Remove the guard petals" width="650" height="650" srcset="https://www.youfloral.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Unpacking_Your_Flowers_Remove_the_guard_petals.jpg 650w, https://www.youfloral.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Unpacking_Your_Flowers_Remove_the_guard_petals-480x480.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 650px, 100vw" /></a></p>
<p>If you ordered roses, you&#8217;ll need to do step 5 &#8211; if not, you&#8217;re done. Easy peasy&#8230;now onto the fun part, arranging!!!</p>
<h3><strong>Step 5: Remove the guard petals</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>We ship our roses with guard petals intact to protect the roses while traveling. These petals might cause the rose to look distorted, discolored, and/or bruised.</li>
<li>You may need to remove up to 8 guard petals per rose (carefully pinch them off) to reveal the pristine quality rose bloom!</li>
</ul>

<p>We thought you might have a few questions about these feathery plumes, so they thought we&#8217;d whip up FAQs on these cloud-like stalks!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youfloral.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Pampas_Grass_FAQs_Pampas_Grass_Available.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2833" src="https://www.youfloral.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Pampas_Grass_FAQs_Pampas_Grass_Available.jpg" alt="Pampas Grass FAQs Pampas Grass Available" width="650" height="650" srcset="https://www.youfloral.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Pampas_Grass_FAQs_Pampas_Grass_Available.jpg 650w, https://www.youfloral.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Pampas_Grass_FAQs_Pampas_Grass_Available-480x480.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 650px, 100vw" /></a></p>
<h3><strong>Is pampas grass available all year?</strong></h3>
<p>Unfortunately no! It is available from August until early spring, so if you want it for your summer wedding, you&#8217;ll need to stock up in advance!</p>
<h3><strong>How do I store it?</strong></h3>
<p>If you&#8217;re displaying it in your house, you can just put it in a vase or decorative vessel &#8211; if you&#8217;re storing it for your wedding, you can keep it in a box, just make sure it&#8217;s in an area where it won&#8217;t get wet!</p>
<h3><strong>Should you water pampas grass?</strong></h3>
<p>No! This is one of the beauties of pampas grass, they are dried &#8211; no risk of killing them!</p>
<h3><strong>How long does pampas grass last? </strong></h3>
<p>Since its dried, it will essentially last forever!</p>
<h3><strong>Will pampas grass shed?</strong></h3>
<p>Pampas grass will shed when you move it around/bump into it/have it in an area with a breeze. To avoid this, try not to move it too frequently and keep it in an area where it won&#8217;t be jostled! If that&#8217;s not possible, not to worry, the shedding isn&#8217;t harmful and your stalks won&#8217;t go bald overnight!</p>
<h3><strong>Should I put hairspray on my pampas grass?</strong></h3>
<p>No, you don&#8217;t need to, you&#8217;ll find that the pampas grass sheds when you move it around &#8211; but as soon as you put it in its final home, the shedding will stop!</p>
<h3><strong>How tall is pampas grass?</strong></h3>
<p>The height is about 2.5 feet tall!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With its beautiful lush greenery and soft green hue, eucalyptus garlands are the perfect tool to take your wedding, holiday, or event decor to the next level! This blog covers how easy it is to make an easy DIY eucalyptus garland.</p>
<p>This tutorial covers how to make a thick eucalyptus garland, if you&#8217;re looking for a lighter look &#8211; you can for-go the wiring and just loosely place the eucalyptus on the table. If you use this method, you&#8217;ll need about half as much eucalyptus.</p>
<h3>Step 1: Gather Your Supplies</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/2NKaymO" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pruners</a> (scissors aren&#8217;t sharp enough)</li>
<li><a href="https://amzn.to/30EFuK7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Thin gauge wire</a> (20-24 gauge)</li>
<li>Silver Dollar Eucalyptus (1 bunch per 4-foot length of the table) (you can use other types of greenery, like salal, ruscus, or cedar)</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.youfloral.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Eucalyptus_Garland_DIY_Gather_Your_Supplies.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2824" src="https://www.youfloral.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Eucalyptus_Garland_DIY_Gather_Your_Supplies.jpg" alt="Eucalyptus Garland DIY Gather Your Supplies" width="650" height="650" srcset="https://www.youfloral.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Eucalyptus_Garland_DIY_Gather_Your_Supplies.jpg 650w, https://www.youfloral.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Eucalyptus_Garland_DIY_Gather_Your_Supplies-480x480.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 650px, 100vw" /></a></p>
<h3>Step 2: Prepare Greenery</h3>
<p>Cut the stems into even sizes, and combine 3-4 stems together into bunches.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youfloral.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Eucalyptus_Garland_DIY_Prepare_Greenery.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2818" src="https://www.youfloral.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Eucalyptus_Garland_DIY_Prepare_Greenery.jpg" alt="Eucalyptus Garland DIY Prepare Greenery" width="650" height="650" srcset="https://www.youfloral.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Eucalyptus_Garland_DIY_Prepare_Greenery.jpg 650w, https://www.youfloral.ca/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Eucalyptus_Garland_DIY_Prepare_Greenery-480x480.jpg 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) 650px, 100vw" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Step 3: Assemble Bunches</h3>
<p>Wire the bunches together, you don&#8217;t need a lot of wire, just enough to ensure the branches stay together (wrap around about 4 &#8211; 5 times). The number of bunches you&#8217;ll need to create depends on the length of your garland.</p>

<h3>Step 4: Begin Creating Your Garland</h3>
<p>Place the next bunch of greenery about 3-4 inches down from the first bunch, covering the stems of the first bunch. Attach the bunches together by wrapping them with wire. Continue layering greenery bunches and securing with wire until garland has reached the desired length.</p>

<h3>Step 5: Finish</h3>
<p>As you work downwards, you&#8217;ll end up with the bottom of the stems showing. To cover this, turn the last greenery bunch in the opposite direction and hide stems by tucking into the leaves of the previous bunch, and then wire it in place.</p>

<h3>Step 6: Add Embellishments</h3>
<p>Add in any embellishments you want, seeded eucalyptus is a great addition, or you can add in flowers as well. If you&#8217;re adding in flowers, add them last minute as flowers do best when in the water!</p>

<h3>Step 7: Ta-da! You&#8217;re Done!</h3>
<p>Eucalyptus is super hardy and will last for weeks if it&#8217;s kept in water. If you&#8217;re making it into a garland it&#8217;s ideal to make this garland as soon to your event as possible, the day before your event is ideal. Without water, the eucalyptus will begin to dry, but that is also a beautiful look as well!</p>
